# Cuisine Classification

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify restaurants based on their cuisines. The model preprocesses the dataset, splits the data into training and testing sets, and then uses a classification algorithm to predict the cuisine type of a restaurant. The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate classification metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and encodes categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Trains a classification algorithm on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes the model's performance across different cuisines and identifies challenges or biases.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about various restaurants, such as:

- Restaurant Name
- Cuisine Type
- Price Range
- Location
- User Ratings
- Ambiance
- Additional features (if any)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cuisine-classification.git
   cd cuisine-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Dataset**: Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

2. **Split the Data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Train the Model**: Select a classification algorithm and train it on the training data.

4. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using classification metrics.


## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The performance of the model is analyzed across different cuisines to identify any challenges or biases.
